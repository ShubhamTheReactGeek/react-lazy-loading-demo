React Lazy Loading Demo

This repository is a demo project showcasing 4 different patterns of lazy loading in React.
Lazy loading is a powerful technique to improve application performance, load times, and user experience by loading code, components, or assets only when they are needed.

🚀 Features

📦 Component-level code splitting – load components on demand.

🛣️ Route-based code splitting – split your app by routes for faster initial loads.

⚡ Hover prefetch – prefetch chunks on hover (Next js has this feature by default).

🖼️ Image lazy loading – load images only when they appear in the viewport.

📚 Patterns Covered

Component-based lazy loading using React.lazy & Suspense.

Route-based code splitting with React Router.

Dynamic import pattern for utilities and non-UI modules.

Image lazy loading with IntersectionObserver.
